An executable that forces display to grayscale on macOS.

To compile, run ``make toggle-grayscale``.

To assign it a shortcut:

1. Copy compiled binary to a sane location

2. Using Automator, create a workflow (quick action)
   which receives no input in any application.
   In it, add “Run AppleScript” action with contents like::

       do shell script "~/bin/toggle-grayscale"

3. Assign preferred shortcut to that action in keyboard preferences.
